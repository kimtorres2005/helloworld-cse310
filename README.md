# Overview

This project is a way for me to practice and improve my programming skills. By working on it, Iâ€™m learning more about {insert specific technology or concept here, e.g., organizing data, building user interfaces, etc.} and applying what I know in a practical way.

The software {briefly describe what it does, e.g., "helps keep track of tasks and lets you set priorities" or "demonstrates basic functions like creating and editing data"}. I created this to {explain the purpose simply, e.g., "build a tool that could be useful for organizing tasks" or "help me learn how to handle data better"}.
